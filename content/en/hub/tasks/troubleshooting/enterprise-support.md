There are a number of options to find support for your TrueNAS installation.
TrueNAS CORE users can engage with the TrueNAS community to answer questions and resolve issues, while TrueNAS Enterprise hardware customers can access the fast and effective support directly provided by iXsystems.

## Support in TrueNAS CORE

There are a number of resources available to TrueNAS CORE users for answering usage questions or troubleshooting system configurations.
It is always recommended to search through the software documentation and community resources for answers to these questions.

Users are also welcome to report bugs and vote for or suggest new TrueNAS features in the project Jira instance.

## Support in TrueNAS Enterprise

In addition to all the TrueNAS CORE support options, TrueNAS Enterprise customers who purchase hardware from iXsystems can contact iXsystems for support if an issue occurs with the system.
Silver and Gold level Support customers can also enable Proactive Support on their hardware to automatically notify iXsystems if an issue occurs.
To find more details about the different Warranty and Service Level Agreement (SLA) options available, see https://www.ixsystems.com/support/.
To purchase support for your iXsystems TrueNAS Enterprise hardware, please call **1-855-GREP-4-IX** (US Toll Free) or **1-408-943-4100**.

### Configuring Proactive Support

Proactive Support notifies iXsystems by email whenever hardware conditions on the system require attention.
This feature is available to iXsystems Silver and Gold Support customers.

Be sure to add valid email addresses and phone numbers for the contacts to be quickly notified of any issues.

You can also toggle automatic iXsystesms support alerts in the system console menu (`/etc/netcli` in the **Shell**).
Failover must be disabled in TrueNAS High Availability systems before this option can be toggled.
To administratively disable failover in the web interface, go to **System > Failover**.
